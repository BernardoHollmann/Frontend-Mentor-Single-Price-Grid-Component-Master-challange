## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Single Price Grid Component Master challenge
  - The challenge consisted in replicating an single price card component for a desktop and mobile view perspective.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS
  - I was very excited at first to try this one. I don't know mucho about the grid system layout and this challange was a good one to try it. First, I set the grid for 2 columns and specified the width with a "vw" measurument and the height with "vh". This gave me a lot of trouble to fix latter, because it messes up the layout of the main container, the grid wrapper. Later on, I switched it to static height and width (using "px" measurement) and it worked. I had other two problemas with this layout, the first one was with the button. I don't know why I couldn't use the width as 100% of the button with a margin right to center it on the div. I had to use a 92% measurument for the button, wich I know its not recommended. The other problem was regarding the h4 for element of the first card. I separated the two tags, according to the given layout, but when I went to the mobile view perspective, both were not as the refered layout. So, I switched the display of both h4 to inline so it can be placed in the same line. However, I don't know how to give it a line high for a inline element. So, I left it as it is.
